## Key Features

*   **Single Email Sender:** Compose and send individual emails with rich text editing (Quill.js) and attachment support using your Gmail account (via App Password).
*   **MassGo Campaigner:** Send bulk email campaigns using multiple Gmail sender accounts and their corresponding app passwords. Includes recipient list management and attachment support for campaigns.
*   **AI Write Assistant:** Leverage Google's Gemini AI (via your Google AI Studio API key) to help draft, refine, or generate email content directly within the composer.
*   **Email Extractor:** Quickly extract valid email addresses from blocks of text.
*   **Google Dork Generator:** Create advanced Google search queries (dorks) tailored for finding publicly listed email addresses or contact information.
*   **Customizable Themes:** Personalize the dashboard appearance with multiple built-in themes (Light, Dark, Ocean, Forest, etc.).
*   **Neobrutalist UI:** Modern, clean, and responsive user interface.
*   **Local Hosting:** Runs entirely on your local machine, ensuring your primary credentials (for single send) and AI API key are managed locally within your browser's storage.

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7+
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
*   **For sending emails:**
    *   A Gmail account with 2-Step Verification enabled.
    *   A 16-character App Password generated for that Gmail account.
*   **For AI features:**
    *   A Google AI Studio API Key.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mailstorm-neo.git
    cd mailstorm-neo
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username/mailstorm-neo` with your actual GitHub repository path after you create it)*

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  Ensure your virtual environment is activated (if you created one).
2.  Run the Flask application from the project's root directory:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
3.  The application will start a local server (usually at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`). It will attempt to open this URL in your default web browser automatically. If not, manually navigate to this address.

## Initial Setup & Usage

### 1. Settings (Crucial First Step!)

Upon first launch, or anytime you need to configure:

*   Navigate to the **‚öôÔ∏è Settings** tab in the sidebar.
*   **Primary Gmail Account:**
    *   Enter **Your Gmail Email** address.
    *   Enter the **16-character Gmail App Password** (NOT your regular Gmail password).
        *   To get an App Password: Go to your Google Account -> Security -> 2-Step Verification (must be ON) -> App passwords. Select "Mail" for app and "Other (Custom name)" for device, name it (e.g., "MailStormNeo"), and Google will generate the password.
    *   Click **üíæ Save Gmail Credentials**. This account is used for sending single emails via the "Compose" and "Send & Monitor" tabs.
*   **Google AI Studio API Key:**
    *   Paste your API key obtained from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    *   Click **üíæ Save AI Studio Key**. This enables the "‚ú® AI Write Assistant" feature.
*   **Theme Selection:**
    *   Choose your preferred dashboard theme from the dropdown.
    *   Click **üíæ Apply & Save Theme**.

*All credentials and preferences are stored locally in your browser's local storage.*

### 2. Composing & Sending Single Emails

*   **‚úèÔ∏è Compose:** Write your email content in the rich text editor, set your display name, and email subject. Attachments can be added via drag & drop or browsing.
*   **üë• Recipients:** Add recipients manually or by uploading a TXT/CSV file.
*   **üöÄ Send & Monitor:** Initiate the sending process. Progress and results will be logged live.

### 3. MassGo Campaigner

*   Navigate to the **‚ö° MassGo** tab.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Set a campaign sender name and subject.
    *   Write the campaign email content in its dedicated rich text editor.
    *   Upload separate `.txt` files: one for Gmail sender email addresses (one per line) and another for their corresponding 16-character App Passwords (one per line, order must match the emails file).
    *   Add attachments for the campaign if needed.
*   **Recipients:** Manage MassGo recipients (manual entry, file upload, or transfer from the main recipients list).
*   **Send Controls:** Initiate the MassGo campaign. The tool will cycle through the provided sender accounts to distribute the email load.

### 4. Productivity Tools

*   **‚úÇÔ∏è Email Extractor:** Paste any block of text to quickly extract unique email addresses.
*   **üîç Dork Generator:** Create targeted Google Dork queries to find publicly listed email addresses or contact information.

### 5. How To Use Guide

*   For more detailed step-by-step instructions on each feature, refer to the **‚ùì How To Use** tab within the application.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Authentication Failed (SMTP):**
    *   Ensure you're using a valid 16-character App Password from Google, not your regular Gmail password.
    *   Verify 2-Step Verification is enabled for the Gmail account(s).
    *   Check for typos in the email or App Password.
*   **AI Model Errors / API Key Invalid:**
    *   Double-check your Google AI Studio API key for correctness.
    *   Ensure the model `gemini-1.5-flash-latest` is available for your API key and region. You might need to adapt `model_name_to_use` in `app.py` if Google changes model availability for your key.
*   **Gmail Sending Limits:**
    *   Standard Gmail accounts have daily sending limits (e.g., around 500 emails/day for free accounts). MassGo helps distribute sends but does not bypass these fundamental limits. Exceeding limits can lead to temporary account restrictions.
*   **Browser Issues:**
    *   If the UI behaves unexpectedly, try clearing your browser's cache and site data for `127.0.0.1:5000`.
*   **Firewall/Antivirus:**
    *   Ensure your firewall or antivirus software isn't blocking Python or the application from making network connections.
